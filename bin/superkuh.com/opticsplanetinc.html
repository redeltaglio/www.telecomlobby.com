<p>In early May 2014 I purchased hydrogen alpha solar telescope. I was in the market for a nice eyepiece and after a quick search of the Amazon marketplace I found a decent price on the Meade 15mm Super Plossl Series 4000 as fulfilled by OpticsPlanet, Inc. Normally Amazon retailers are well regulated so I didn't bother searching beyond Amazon itself for feedback about this company. Big mistake.</p>

<p>OpticsPlanet, Inc called a few days later and said they did not have the item I ordered in stock, but would I like to substitute either of two available inferior eyepieces? This was classic bait and switch tactics but I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. When I politely declined their agent then told me I would have to wait 3 weeks for my order to even begin shipping. I was in no rush so I decided to wait.</p>

<p>Well, 3 weeks past. During that time I kept up polite communications with OpticsPlanet, Inc representatives. It seemed each time I contacted them the date at which they would even receive the item to begin shipping it to me would be pushed back another week. Then they stopped communicating at all and began simply sending form letters.</p>

<p>Eventually, a month and a half later, they simply canceled the order entirely.</p>

<p>The benefit of doubt is now gone. OpticsPlanet, Inc are definitely scammers. I confirmed this by doing a little bit of web searches for similar tales. I found many similar experiences to mine all over forums on the web. Yet OpticsPlanet, Inc somehow manages to keep their Amazon rating relatively high. It is almost entirely 5/5 and 1/5 ratings. This kind of rating skew is typical of scammers gaming the system.</p>

<h3>If you are here reading this because you are about to order from OpticsPlanet, Inc reconsider it. There are probably other non-scammy retailers you can get the product from.</h3>

<p>Here is a collection of similar feedback to mine that is hidden by all the SEO/false cover feedback they maintain,</p>

<p class="quote">1/5: "When I ordered it said in stock but a week after supposed to arrive I received an email saying it would be 3-4 more weeks before it would ship but they did refund my purchase promptly after I canceled my order" justins3269, June 9, 2014</p>

<p class="quote">2/5: "They sent me the wrong item, and then didn't even stock the correct item in the first place and I actually had to call them to figure this out because their online return process was such a pain!

<p class="quote">1/5: "Don't buy from them. They're refusing to refund my money & won't go through Amazon's return.

<p class="quote">3/5: "Seller could not send this. I find it odd that someone is selling a product they don't have, and cannot get. I have bought other gauges from them that we're delivered promptly. I like this tool, but I guess the 380 size won't happen." ccollier, June 2, 2014</p>

<p class="quote">1/5: "Stay Away... They advertise Leatherman Charge ALX 6061-T6 Multi Tool with Black Oxide Molle Sheath 830795 - Plus Leatherman 931009 Bit Driver Extension. No extension in the package? Their excuse is the ad is wrong? ...they don't know what they're selling on Amazon?? I'll stay away from OpticsPlanet in future.

<p class="quote">3/5: "The binoculars never arrived. I did receive an email warning me that the item had not arrived and asking me if I wished to proceed. I cancelled the order." Jim Willems, May 22, 2014</p>
<p class="quote">2/5: "Bought item that was "in stock". Called the next day and was told item was on a 5-7 week backorder. Prior to that I contacted Optics Planet to see if they were selling the updated version and they had no answer but " we sell the newest versions of all our products". I have a feeling I would have gotten the old one." Patrick Lyons, May 22, 2014</p>
<p class="quote">1/5: "After sending me notification that my product was back ordered and will be further late to arrive, you sent me notice as a further late date of arrival as may 9-19. Well, it is may 22, and my produst is not here yet. FYI, I bought another same pair, same time, from Sports by Sager Inc. and it arrived 3 weeks ago. You will NOT be getting a good review AT ALL from me !!" terry caris, May 21, 2014</p>
<p class="quote">1/5: "They cancelled our harness so we do not know if it would have been as described. When we ordered it, they said they had 3 in stock but they never shipped it and it was out of stock by the delivery date." Lynn W., May 20, 2014</p>

<p>And it just goes on and on. These are only the complaints over a couple weeks. OpticsPlanet, Inc sells things it doesn't have, tries to bait and switch, and then cancels orders.</p>

		<h4>About</h4>
		<p>I enjoy recursion, dissipating local energy gradients, lipid bilayers, particle acceleration, heliophysics instrumentation and generally anything with a high rate of change in electrical current. This site is a combination of my efforts to archive what I find interesting and my shoddy attempts to implement it as cheap as possible.</p>

<!-- <p>I believe the nerve action potential is an electrical manipulation of reversible abrupt phase changes in the lipid bilayer of neurons.</p><p>This is an example of the electrocaloric effect in which a change in an applied electric field produces a change in entropy and, consequently, a change in temperature. The electrical field is produced by changes in the concentration of divalent calcium_2+ ions. The entropy is reduced in the phospholipid bilayer because of their carboxyl head's affinity for the Ca2+ ion over the sodium Na+1. The exchange creates ordering because multiple lipids (~3) bond to Ca2+ but only one bonds to Na+.</p> -->
