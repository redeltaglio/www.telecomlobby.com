		<p>I'm almost finished with Linda Nagata's two books extending the "Deception Well" / "nanotech succession" series. "Memory" and "Edges". Both are far future books where humanity is mostly either evolved into not humanity or dead and hiding like mice from the rest of the galaxy. The characters are mostly contemporary humans. The tech is never explained in any detail but it's consistent. In fact for not having any tech detail, ever, these books have interesting tech driven plots. It's magic nanotech goo everywhere but the magic goo is still constrained by physics somewhat. 8/10. Worth reading if you read the deception well series but if you haven't yet the tech will seem even more hand-wavey and unsupported.</p>
