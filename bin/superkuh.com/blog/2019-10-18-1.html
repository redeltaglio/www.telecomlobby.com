		<p>These trees are pretty fucking neato. The helical seed pods are more than a foot long and an inch or two wide. They're big, fleshy things in the summer and in the winter they dry out into excellent little noisemakers when shaken. These are domesticated, thornless varieties of course. The wild honey locust is literally a threat to man and his machines. The giant spikes it grows can puncture tractor tires. Some scientists think they evolved the giant deadly-to-humans spikes to keep mammoths from damaging the tree trunk as the seed pods were a favorite food source. That's metal. Here's some random google images photo of one from someone that isn't me,</p>
