		<p>In cold climates in winter human drivers don't follow the official lane markings because they can't be seen. They follow the paths in the snow everyone else has packed down. These paths often diverge from the road markings. Any attempt to create an absolute positioning rather than vision based system like humans use is doomed to failure. No amount of technology injected into roads rather than cars will help because that's not how humans drive and humans are the priority users of the road transport system.</p>

		<p>This doesn't just happen during and after snowfall. It's a permanent feature of side streets for months. It's not a transient effect. Regulation of autonomous land vehicles in cold climates will have to be different from temperate ones.</p>
